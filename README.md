# WindowsUtility&mdash;or what's left of it

This is an archive of whatever I could find of my first text-based programming project. [`WindowsUtility.bat`](./WindowsUtility.bat) is partially recreated from the first 3 pages of a printout ([`scanned.pdf`](./scanned.pdf)) and a bit of help from [`ocrmypdf`](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF).

My motivation was to build something that would provide a set of shortcuts for many of the things I would normally do with a mouse. Through trial and error and presumably with a lot of Googling, I found command line shortcuts for things like:
- logging off
- shutting down
- ejecting a CD

The printout is dated 7 April 2012, just over 5 weeks before my 11th birthday.
